>***Chardalyn Carapace.*** Any time Vedlar would take damage or otherwise be affected by a spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1 to 5, he gains a number of d6 per level of  the spell cast to store for his Supernova ability and suffers the effect of that spell normally. On a 6, the spell has no effect.  
>
>***Legendary Resistance (5/Day).*** If Vedlar fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.  
>
>***Titanic Size.*** Vedlar is titanic in size. Whenever he hits a creature with an attack, every square within 5 feet of them becomes difficult terrain permanently.  
>
>***Wrath of the Vikan Realm (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If Vedlar would be reduced to 0 hit points, its current hit point total instead resets to 620 hit points, it recharges its Hyperbeam, and it regains any expended uses of Legendary Resistance. Additionally, Vedlar can now use the options in the "Mythic Actions" section for 1 hour.  
>If Vedlar seems bitchmade halfway through the Mythic stage of the fight, add 200hp  
>
>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** Vedlar uses Malevolent presence and then makes one Claw and two Tail attacks. These attacks cannot target the same creature.  
>
>***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 36 (4d12 + 10) slashing damage.   
>This attack scores a critical hit if the number on the d20 is 18 or higher. Critical hits with this attack deal *Hit:* 88 (12d12 + 10) force damage.  
>
>***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (2d12 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 27 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.  
>
>***Malevolent Presence.*** Any creature with an Intelligence of 4 or more that is within eyesight of Vedlar must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by it for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Vedlar's Malevolent Presence for the next 24 hours.   
>-----  
>A creature charmed in this way fixates on another creature or object that Vedlar mentally chooses and must, on each of its turns, move as close as it can to that target and use its action to make a melee attack against it.  
>-----  
>If Vedlar doesn't choose a target, the charmed creature can act normally on its turn.  
>
>***Hyperbeam (Recharge 5â€“6).*** Vedlar exhales a ray of radiant energy in a 300-foot cone. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking *Hit:* 67 (15d8) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
>
>### Legendary Actions
>Vedlar can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Vedlar regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
>- **Move.** Vedlar can move up to its movement speed. This movement provokes opportunity attacks.
>- **Attack.** Vedlar makes one Claw or Tail attack. A claw attack made this way cannot critically strike.
>- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** Vedlar beats its wings. Each creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 26 Dexterity saving throw or take *Hit:*  17 (2d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Vedlar can then fly up to half its flying speed.
>- **Supernova (Costs 3 Actions).** Vedlar can expel energy stored within his Chardalyn Carapace. Each creature in a 120 foot radius must make a DC 21 Constitution or Dexterity (Player's choice) saving throw, taking the number of d6 radiant damage stored on a failed save or half as much on a success.
  -----
  Anyone who takes damage from this ability rolls a D20 and is placed in to Vedlar's Target order.
>
>### Mythic Actions
>If Vedlar's Wrath of the Vikan Realm trait has activated in the last hour, it can use the options below as legendary actions.
>
Additionally, Vedlar's amount of legendary actions per round increases to 5.
>
>- **The Whispered Realm (Costs 2 Actions).** Vedlar targets the creature with the highest corresponding number in its target order. The creature must succeed on a DC 21 Charisma saving throw or take 44 (8d10) psychic damage and be banished to The Vikan realm, either way, they are removed from Vedlar's target order. 
  -----
  If a creature starts their turn in the Vikan realm, they must make weapon attacks against their own armor class and deal damage as if they were fighting themselves, as a copy of their soul combats them in the Vikan realm. They must make the maximum number of attacks possible.
  -----
  At the start of Vedlar's next turn, the creature reappears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it.
>- **Hypernova (Costs 3 Actions).** Vedlar flares with radiant energy. Each creature of Vedlar's choice in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on it must make a DC 21 Constitution or Dexterity (Player's choice) saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 39 (12d6) radiant damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
  -----
  Anyone who takes damage from this ability rolls a D20 and is placed in to Vedlar's Target order.
